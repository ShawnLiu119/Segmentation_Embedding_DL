        "**Event**: customer event sequence could be product browsing history on website, clicks, in store purchase, transactions </br>\n",
        "**Doc2Vec**: vectorize the document: Doc2Vec is a neural network-based approach that learns the distributed representation of documents. It is an unsupervised learning technique that maps each document to a fixed-length vector in a high-dimensional space\n",
        "\n",
        "## Use Case\n",
        "1. **segmentation** capture behavioral semantics and use these embeddings for audience analysis (e.g. clustering)\n",
        "2. **recommendation engine** input for the downstream personalization models\n",
        "\n",
        "## Logical thoughts\n",
        "Each customer is viewed as a document, orders as sentences, and products as words. Each customer could place multiple orders, while one order could include multiple products\n",
        "\n",
        "## MLOPs consideration\n",
        " The dataset size and compute resources need to be carefully selected because Doc2Vec and subsequent clustering are computationally heavy processes."
